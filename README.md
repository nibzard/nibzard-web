### Key Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable Astro components (e.g., `LogItem.astro`) for a consistent UI.
- **Modular Styling**:
    - Styles are organized by component (e.g., `src/styles/components/log-entry.css`).
    - **CSS Variables** (`src/styles/variables.css`) are used for design tokens (colors, spacing, typography), enabling easy theming and consistency.
    - Common utility classes are available for spacing, typography, etc.
- **Content Collections**: Markdown/MDX content is organized within `src/content/`.
- **Responsive Design**: A mobile-first approach ensures the site adapts to all screen sizes using responsive breakpoints.

### Style System
The project uses a comprehensive style system with:

- **CSS Variables**: For colors, spacing, typography, and more, defined in `src/styles/variables.css`.
- **Component Styles**: Each UI component typically has its own dedicated CSS file (e.g., `src/styles/components/log-entry.css`).
- **Utility Classes**: A set of common utility classes for fine-tuning layout and typography.
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Media queries are used to ensure a mobile-first responsive design.
