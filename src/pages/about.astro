      <h1>About Nikola Balić</h1>
      <h2>Architecting Growth in the AI Era</h2>

      <p>I build go-to-market engines for technical products that matter.</p>

      <p>At Daytona, I transformed our GTM approach as a solo growth/marketing role and early hire. Over the course of 2 years:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scaled GitHub stars to 20,000+</li>
        <li>Secured #1 and two #2 Product Hunt launches</li>
        <li>Elevated Daytona.io from DR 0 to 49</li>
        <li>Built engaged communities across platforms (2.7K X, 5.3K LinkedIn, 700+ YouTube)</li>
        <li>Pivoted our core offering from cloud development environments to AI runtimes for agentic workflows</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This builds on 14+ years of scaling innovation ecosystems, deploying €34M+ in EU funds, and driving product growth at 54% YoY. I've established business incubators, guided fintechs through explosive growth phases, and mastered large-scale communication strategies.</p>

      <p>I lecture in Data Science at university, focusing on NoSQL and Complex Network Analysis, while pursuing doctoral research in Digital Transformation with published academic work.</p>

      <h2>My Approach</h2>
      <p>Innovation thrives at the edge. I test boundaries—from AI-native databases to LLM-powered code environments—publishing experimental work on <a href="https://github.com/nkkko" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>. My current focus: multi-agent AI orchestration and how it will transform our building, learning, and scaling paradigms.</p>

      <h2>The Difference</h2>
      <p>I translate complex technical concepts into accessible outcomes. My specialty is taking engineer-built tools and making them irresistible to broader markets. I move fluidly between development, data science, growth marketing, and business strategy—creating clarity where there was confusion.</p>

      <h2>Let's Build Something Significant</h2>
      <p>If you're ready to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Launch and scale your next devtools or AI product</li>
        <li>Outpace competitors through strategic experimentation</li>
        <li>Transform technical innovations into market adoption</li>
        <li>Convert complexity into actionable results</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>The market doesn't reward safe plays. I'm here to create breakthroughs that bend the curve.</em></p>
