"Play long-term games with long-term people." â€” Naval Ravikant

This hits different when someone extracts value from you, then actively works to devalue you.

Long-term games compound. Trust compounds. Reputation compounds.

The short-term player takes what they need, then burns the bridge to prevent you from collecting on the relationship later. It's extraction with sabotage, ensuring the value only flows one way.

Long-term people understand that they protect your reputation because it's connected to theirs.

When you find your long-term people, you've found something rare: partners who understand that mutual success compounds.
