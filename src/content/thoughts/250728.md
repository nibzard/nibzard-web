"Play long-term games with long-term people." — Naval Ravikant

This hits different when someone extracts value from you, then actively works to devalue you. Not just disappearing—but staying around to poison the well.

Long-term games compound. Trust compounds. Reputation compounds. The person you help today might open doors you didn't even know existed five years from now.

Short-term games are zero-sum. Long-term games create new value that didn't exist before. The difference between taking from a pie versus making the pie bigger.

The short-term player takes what they need, then burns the bridge to prevent you from collecting on the relationship later. It's extraction with sabotage—ensuring the value only flows one way.

Long-term people understand that today's favor becomes tomorrow's opportunity. They protect your reputation because it's connected to theirs.

When you find your long-term people, you've found something rare: partners who understand that mutual success compounds.
