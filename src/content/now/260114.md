## Ted Chiang Reading

I've been devouring Ted Chiang short stories lately. They feel especially relevant right now - his explorations of AI, language, and human intelligence hit differently when you're living through the actual reality of those concepts. The way he thinks about technology not as good or bad, but as something that changes us, has been rattling around in my head.

## ESP32 + AI Coding Agents

Playing with ESP32 embedded development, but the twist is I'm doing it entirely through AI coding agents. It's a weird experience - writing C++ for microcontrollers without really knowing C++. The agents handle the register configurations, the memory management, the weird ESP-IDF quirks. I'm mostly just describing what I want the hardware to do. It works, but I'm not sure how I feel about not understanding the stack I'm building on.

## The AI Coding Moment

Something shifted over the holidays. A lot of people discovered or rediscovered AI coding tools. Even Linus Torvalds has a vibe-coded project on his GitHub now. When that happens, you know it's gone mainstream. The collective "oh, this actually works" moment seems to have hit all at once.

## Agentic Patterns Traction

This wave has been wild for my [agentic-patterns.com](https://agentic-patterns.com/) project - it picked up over 2.4k GitHub stars in just a week. What started as a documentation project for myself is now something people are actually using. The timing was accidental but lucky. I need to figure out what to do with it - keep it as a reference, turn it into something more interactive, or just let it be what it is.
