## Personal Website CMS

I've toyed with creating a personal website for years--something beyond just a blog. I've started many before but never had the discipline to maintain them. Now, finally I have something close to my mental ideal. In addition to ths Astro based site, I did a light weight git based CMS for managing "collections" (think: posts, etc.) with Groq integration to write frontmatter. This was one-shotted with Claude 4 Sonnet (prompt design), v0 (prototype), and then fixed to make it work with Claude Code.

## Current Focus

Still reading "AI Engineer" by @chipro--it's exceptionally well-written and thoroughly researched, warm recommendation. But, as always, I have several books around the house in various stages of reading; Stephen King's On Writing, some Lee Child book (fascinated by the sheer flow of words), and Superagency by Reid Hoffman on my Kindle.

## Daily Routine

It is really hard to hit 10k steps, last night I did 76 minutes of walking just to hit the goal, barely. The day was slow.
