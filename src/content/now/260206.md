## Joined Steel.dev

I joined Steel.dev! You can read my latest article on [how the web will be automated](/agent-web) and why I joined. Being so early and working with early teams is a rewarding experience that unlocks potential. I'm very happy to start this journey.

## Semester Break

Finally, the winter semester is finished. I'm taking a break from lecturing as it was quite exhausting this time around.

## AI Model Experiments

I've been experimenting with the latest models from Anthropic and OpenAI. Codex 5.3 with extra high reasoning is currently state-of-the-art — it offers the best experience I've had. It works for half an hour and solves previously unsolvable problems, even compared to 5.2 extra high.

## Fishing Again

I've started fishing again. Bought a new surfcasting rod from Decathlon and have already lost 3 sinkers.

## Agent Cheat Code

Self-learning is a fantastic cheat code for agents: just add one line to your AGENTS.md file to keep LESSONS_LEARNED.md as it works on the project.
