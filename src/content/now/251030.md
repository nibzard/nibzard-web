## Academic Year Begins

The academic year has started and I'm diving into teaching new subjects. Introduction to Software Engineering and Science Programming - both with heavy AI bias. The students are skeptical about AI usage, which is fascinating. They've been trained to avoid tool dependency, now we're telling them AI collaboration is essential. There's real cognitive dissonance happening.

## AI Infrastructure Ruminations

Thinking a lot about AI infrastructure futures, Agent Labs, and where Steel.dev fits. The agentic guardrails question keeps surfacing - how do we balance autonomy with safety as systems become more capable and interconnected?

## PhD Direction Reconsideration

Rapid AI evolution has me reconsidering my PhD direction. What seemed relevant a year ago might not be the most impactful research focus now. Need to map real research gaps versus where commercial solutions are moving quickly.

## AI Writing Interfaces

Playing with future of AI writing interfaces on the side. Current tools feel like the beginning - so much potential for more intuitive, collaborative writing that blurs human/AI contribution lines naturally.
