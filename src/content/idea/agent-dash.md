Simplify AI operations with **AI Agents Dashboard**â€”a single web interface that combines [container-use](https://github.com/dagger/container-use), [Coder AgentAPI](https://github.com/coder/agentapi), and [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code). Launch a primary agent instance from the dashboard, which then spins up additional isolated agent environments in containers. Monitor resource usage, health, and logs in real time, and start, stop, or scale any agent without using the command line.

*"Orchestrate AI at scale, one container at a time."*

**Target market:**
DevOps teams, AI researchers, and software engineers who need an easy way to deploy, observe, and control multiple Claude agents within containerized workflows.
