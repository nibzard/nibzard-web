Two years ago, I wouldn't have dreamed of publishing a Chrome extension.

Today, [FollowSaver](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/followsaver/afagodpjbincnkhpcgjfbbmififoahch) sits in the Chrome Web Store. Approved in under 24 hours. Apache 2.0 licensed. Zero cost to users.

**The only manual work I did?** Screenshots and an icon.

## The Algorithm Insight

It started with [analyzing Twitter's recommendation algorithm](https://nibzard.github.io/twitter-algorithm-tufte). Claude Code and I dissected the two-stage ranking system, engagement hierarchies, and network effects.

**Key discovery**: Twitter prioritizes "two-hop" connections—friends of friends. Your network's network matters more than random follows.

**The problem**: Most people follow randomly, missing algorithmic leverage.

**The solution**: Build a tool that helps you analyze following vs. followers.

## The Chrome Web Store Transformation

Claude didn't just build the extension—it guided the entire submission process. Privacy policies, manifest requirements, store optimization, compliance documentation. Everything I would have spent weeks learning.

**Submission to approval: 24 hours.**

## What Really Happened

This wasn't about building a Chrome extension. This was about **AI democratizing capabilities** that used to require specialized knowledge.

**Traditional development path**:
- Learn Chrome APIs and manifest syntax
- Master Web Store policies and requirements
- Write legal compliance documentation
- Create distribution infrastructure

**AI-assisted path**:
- Describe the problem clearly
- Provide UX direction and feedback
- Create visual assets
- Submit and ship

The technical barrier evaporated. What remains is product sense and execution.

## The Extension Philosophy

FollowSaver embodies the Twitter algorithm insights:

- **Local-first**: Your data never leaves your browser
- **ToS-compliant**: Works within Twitter's guidelines
- **Actionable**: Shows exactly who to follow/unfollow for algorithmic advantage
- **Zero friction**: One-click CSV export for analysis

Simple. Effective. Solves a real problem.

## The Meta-Lesson

Five years ago, Chrome extension development meant learning APIs, policies, and infrastructure.

Today, it means having a clear problem and good judgment about solutions.

**The technical barrier disappeared.** What's left is understanding what users actually need.

## For Aspiring Developers

Want to ship your own extension? The playbook is simple:

1. **Find a real problem** you personally experience
2. **Use AI for implementation** while maintaining control over experience
3. **Keep it simple**—solve one thing really well
4. **Go local-first**—privacy builds trust
5. **Let AI handle compliance**—policies, forms, technical requirements

## The Future of Development

AI didn't replace developer skills. It amplified developer **taste**.

The future belongs to those who know what to build, not just how to build it. Technical implementation is becoming commoditized. Product intuition and user empathy are becoming the scarce resources.

When anyone can ship software in hours instead of months, the question isn't whether you can build it.

The question is whether you should.
