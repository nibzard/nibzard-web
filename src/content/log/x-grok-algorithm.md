X's recommendation algorithm just got a complete rewrite. And it's not just an update—it's a fundamental shift to Grok's transformer architecture.

<blockquote class="featured-quote primary">
The old pipeline is gone. In-network posts, out-of-network ML retrieval, the two-stage ranking system—everything has been rearchitected around Grok's transformer model.

Elon open-sourced the code last week, called it "dumb," and admitted the algorithm has been flooding feeds with irrelevant junk. Which is exactly why I updated my playbook.

I analyzed the closed-source code exclusively—no documentation, no guides, just the raw implementation—and rewrote the entire guide to reflect what's actually happening under the hood.

The engagement signal hierarchy has changed. The ranking logic is different. Even the ad recommendation system is now Grok-powered.

**The updated X Algorithm Playbook** (https://nibzard.github.io/twitter-algorithm-tufte/) now covers:

- Grok's transformer architecture replacing traditional ML
- How the new in-network vs out-of-network retrieval works
- Updated engagement signal weights
- Why niche posts are getting buried under low-quality recommendations
- What creators can actually do about it

Same Edward Tufte design—ET Book typography, sidenotes, print-first layout—but with completely fresh content based on the January 2026 release.

Technical documentation should show you what's real. Not what marketing claims.
