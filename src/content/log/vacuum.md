There's a curious phenomenon happening in engineering teams across the industry. The most experienced developers—those who've built systems from scratch, debugged the impossible, and shipped products that millions use—are often the most skeptical about AI coding tools.

I call it the AI vacuum: a gap in perception between what senior engineers see as valuable and what actually transforms user experiences.

Here's the thing about incremental improvements: they're deceptively powerful. Take an existing product—one that works, that users tolerate, that gets the job done. Now add a small AI component. Maybe it's smarter autocomplete, better error messages, or predictive suggestions. Nothing revolutionary. Nothing that rewrites the architecture.

But from the user's perspective? Magic.

That slightly better search that seems to read their mind. The form that fills itself out intelligently. The error message that actually helps instead of frustrates. These aren't just features—they're perception shifters. They transform a functional product into one that feels alive, responsive, almost telepathic.

Senior engineers, trained to think in systems and scalability, often miss this. They see the AI component as a small addition to an existing codebase. Users see it as the moment the product finally understood them.

The vacuum exists because experience can become a blind spot. When you've built enough systems, you start measuring value in terms of architectural elegance or technical complexity. But users don't care about your beautiful abstractions. They care about whether the product feels like it was built just for them.

The most successful products of the next decade won't be the ones with the most sophisticated AI. They'll be the ones that use AI to make existing experiences just a little bit more magical—and recognize that "a little bit" can change everything.
