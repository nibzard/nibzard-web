I just watched AI rescue a failed Mistral.ai clone in a single prompt.

Model: GPT-5.3 Codex in xhigh reasoning mode. Task: Fix a broken replica that a previous AI couldn't complete.

It analyzed the production site, extracted the design system from their brand page, identified the broken implementation, and rebuilt component by component—Hero, Navigation, Features, Footer—with custom Mistral orange (#F16F14) throughout.

No iterative prompting. No hand-holding. One prompt, production-ready rescue.

The implications? Web development as we know it is ending. The "build phase" of software just collapsed from weeks to seconds. Agencies charging $50k for marketing sites are about to be disrupted out of existence.

We still have ~10% for humans—the thoughtful prompting, the taste, the direction. But expect that percentage to keep shrinking. Each model release takes another bite.

We're not in the "orchestration era" anymore. We're in the **instantiation era**.
