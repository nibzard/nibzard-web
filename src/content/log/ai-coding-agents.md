We’re past the point where “AI coding agents” means a single category. The ecosystem has fractured into multiple agents, each with strengths and quirks.

# The Niche Map

* **Cloud Code** → first to innovate, MAX tokens, sub-agents, hooks.
* **Amp Code** → best code search + shareable threads.
* **OpenCode** → clean UI + model flexibility.
* **Codex CLI** → GPT-5 scalpel precision.
* **Gemini CLI** → huge context, free brute-force QA with Playwright MCP.

# Why This Matters

It’s tempting to chase the “best agent.” But in practice, it’s the *fit* that matters: context window for QA, precision for surgical CLI work, UI and formatting for in-terminal workflows, interfaces that don’t get in your way.

# The Pattern

Every generation of tools doesn’t converge, it diverges. 

Innovation happens in the edges: someone solves formatting, someone tools, others scale, someone nails interaction design. Together, they form a toolkit, not a monolith.

The winners won’t be those who just stack the strongest all inclusive offer, but those who orchestrate across niches.

That’s the play.
